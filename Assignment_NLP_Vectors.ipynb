We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n","\n","Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n","\n","On the python side, we will be focusing on `sklearn` and `spacy` today.  \n","\n","## Case Study\n","\n","We're going to pretend we're on the datascience team at the BBC.

The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\\n\\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage.

The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (£130,000) fine.\\n\\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":35}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"PDM_NrH7IBr8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671307757272,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Danny Carvey","userId":"13526458158366310008"}},"outputId":"b1b65bbc-8b90-40cc-e4d6-15fb9656f63b"},"source":["data[67]"],"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'T-Mobile bets on \\'pocket office\\'\\n\\nT-Mobile has launched its latest \"pocket office\" third-generation (3G) device which also has built-in wi-fi - high-speed wireless net access.\\n\\nUnlike other devices where the user has to check which high-speed network is available to transfer data, the device selects the fastest one itself. The MDA IV, released in the summer, is an upgrade to the company\\'s existing smartphone, the 2.5G/wi-fi MDA III. It reflects the push by mobile firms for devices that are like mini laptops. The device has a display that can be swivelled and angled so it can be used like a small computer, or as a conventional clamshell phone. The Microsoft Mobile phone, with two cameras and a Qwerty keyboard, reflects the design of similar all-in-one models released this year, such as Motorola\\'s MPx. \"One in five European workers are already mobile - meaning they spend significant time travelling and out of the office,\" Rene Obermann, T-Mobile\\'s chief executive, told a press conference at the 3GSM trade show in Cannes. He added: \"What they need is their office when they are out of the office.\" T-Mobile said it was seeing increasing take up for what it calls \"Office in a Pocket\" devices, with 100,000 MDAs sold in Europe already.\\n\\nIn response to demand, T-Mobile also said it would be adding the latest phone-shaped Blackberry to its mobile range. Reflecting the growing need to be connected outside the office, it announced it would introduce a flat-fee £20 ($38) a month wi-fi tariff for people in the UK using its wi-fi hotspots. It said it would nearly double the number of its hotspots - places where wi-fi access is available - globally from 12,300 to 20,000.\\n\\nIt also announced it was installing high-speed wi-fi on certain train services, such as the UK\\'s London to Brighton service, to provide commuters a fast net connection too. The service, which has been developed with Southern trains, Nomad Digital (who provide the technology), begins with a free trial on 16 trains on the route from early March to the end of April. A full service is set to follow in the summer. Wi-fi access points will be connected to a Wimax wireless network - faster than wi-fi - running alongside the train tracks. Brian McBride, managing director of T-Mobile in the UK, said: \"We see a growing trend for business users needing to access e-mail securely on the move.\\n\\n\"We are able to offer this by maintaining a constant data session for the entire journey.\" He said this was something other similar in-train wi-fi services, such as that offered on GNER trains, did not offer yet. Mr Obermann added that the mobile industry in general was still growing, with many more opportunities for more services which would bear fruit for mobile companies in future. Thousands of mobile industry experts are gathered in Cannes, France, for the 3GSM which runs from 14 to 17 February.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Which words do these two documents have in common?"],"metadata":{"id":"GJvImw9sYxQ7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def shared_words(s1, s2):\n","  res = []\n","  l_s1, l_s2 = set(s1.split()), set(s2.split())\n","  for ss1 in l_s1:\n","    if ss1 in l_s2: res.append(ss1)\n","  return res\n","\n","doc1_tokens = tokenize(data[0])\n","doc2_tokens = tokenize(data[146])\n","shared_words(' '.join(doc1_tokens), ' '.join(doc2_tokens))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zlxQ968QYtrm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671307757495,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":232,"user":{"displayName":"Danny Carvey","userId":"13526458158366310008"}},"outputId":"af44fe07-8cfc-4a94-d8bf-009f2debce91"},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['call',\n"," 'network',\n"," 'firm',\n"," 'software',\n"," 'allow',\n"," 'hand',\n"," 'music',\n"," 'home',\n"," 'carry',\n"," 'service',\n"," 'new',\n"," 'game',\n"," 'large',\n"," 'year',\n"," 'fight',\n"," 'download',\n"," 'digital']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LhG-KESidGIn"},"source":["### Exercise: \n","Search the BBC dataset for documents most similar to a random query doc"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ouWYmCawdRAT","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671307757496,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Danny Carvey","userId":"13526458158366310008"}},"outputId":"14d633b3-ee93-43af-be14-cd7ef6977666"},"source":["rndm_tech_article = [ \"\"\"\n","Blockchain technology encompasses so much more than just cryptocurrencies these days.

Bill Thompson thinks it's about time.\\n\\nMy first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as I drove around Cambridge. Now you can't buy petrol with lead additives, and we're all better off as a result. Chip giant Intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too, reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.\\n\\nApart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. And work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient, since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops, mobiles and music players.\\n\\nOne of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. If you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. A well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. This is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in Europe since from August the new Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.\\n\\nThey will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit, something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. It is, as they say, about time. We have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment, and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. The car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder, a phenomenon called 'knocking', so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. Redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work, so it took decades before it was done. We're seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come. If Apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new Mac Mini and throwing away their old PC, keeping the monitor and other peripherals.\\n\\nEven if Apple does not get its way, four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it's not unreasonable to replace them. But what do we do with the old ones?\\n\\nI've just looked around my office and I find two monitors, an old 386 PC, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a Sun workstation that is no longer really much use. They are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it's possible that some of the components could be useful. I could take them up the to the council recycling centre, but it's a 10-mile drive away across town, and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. Here in Cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste, a box for glass, cans and paper that can be recycled, and a black bin for the rest. There are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. Would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too? I'd probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.\\n\\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\\n\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["doc1_tokens = tokenize(rndm_tech_article[0])\n","doc2_tokens = tokenize(data[393])\n","shared_words(' '.join(doc1_tokens), ' '.join(doc2_tokens))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ahhuYL0GaXK9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1671307757749,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":132,"user":{"displayName":"Danny Carvey","userId":"13526458158366310008"}},"outputId":"a95c651d-80be-41e6-96a2-12fb448f4d34"},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['complete',\n"," 'possible',\n"," 'make',\n"," 'technology',\n"," 'way',\n"," 'case',\n"," 'time',\n"," 'lot',\n"," 'industry',\n"," 'reduce',\n"," 'potential',\n"," 'player',\n"," 'use']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":43}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RaSuFg0ldRAT"},"source":["## Challenge\n","\n","In the module project assignment, you will apply one of these search techniques to retrieve documents related to a query document.

This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n","\n","### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n","Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n","\n","##3.1 Word2Vec Intuition\n","Reference: [Deep NLP: Word Vectors with Word2Vec](https://medium.com/deep-learning-demystified/deep-nlp-word-vectors-with-word2vec-d62cb29b40b3)\n","### The Distribution Hypothesis\n","\n","In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the [Distribution Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n","\n","> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n","\n","This means that we let the usage of a word define its meaning and its \"similarity\" to other words.
